# Raft

This is a simple implementation of the Raft consenus algorithm that follows the [Raft Paper](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/raft-atc14)
to determine requirements. 

**NOTE:** This implementation is purely meant for educational purposes so that I could continue learning more about distributed systems. It is
not intended for any production use.

## TODO
- [ ] Initialize app structure and required packages, etc.
- [ ] Work on Raft cluster election, including Candidate, Leader and Followers.
- [ ] Raft consensus using logs.
- [ ] Persistence of vital state information.
